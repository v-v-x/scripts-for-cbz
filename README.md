# scripts-for-cbz
Auxiliary scripts for CBZ production:

rn.py renames all jpegs in current folder in natural order as 0001.jpeg, 0002.jpeg etc.

ar.py archives all jpegs by zip in deflated mode and change .zip to .cbz

reverse.py renames all jpegs in current folder in inverse order as 0001.jpeg, 0002.jpeg etc. It's useful for true manga books with inverse order of pages.
